                    Our Chairman <Strong>Thomas Mar Themotheos</Strong> , Metropolitan
                    (Arch-Bishop) of Kottayam Diocese was ordained as the
                    Metropolitan of the Outside Kerala Diocese on 3rd
                    January 1991. Thomas was born on 2nd May 1950 in the
                    Muriyankal family of the Lakkattoor village (Kottayam
                    District, Kerala, India) to Mr. Kurian Kuruvilla and
                    Mrs. Annamma Kuruvilla, as the sixth of their eight
                    children. Thomas had his initial primary education in
                    the village CMS (Church Missionary Society School)
                    originally the Anglican Church Missionary Society.
                    Middle School and High School education were completed
                    at the Amayannoor High School. IN 1964, while in the
                    ninth grade, Thomas was ordained as sub-deacon (Korooyo)
                    by Mar Philexinos Paulose (later Catholicos Baselius
                    Paulose II) who was then Metropolitan of the Kottayam
                    Diocese.

                    His parish priest, Cor Episcopo V. Rev. Thomas
                    Mattathil, imparted early instruction in Syriac and
                    liturgical rites. Having completed the Secondary School
                    Leaving Certificate (SSLC) examination in 1965, Dn.
                    Thomas joined the Baselius College, Kottayam for
                    Pre-Degree course. Subsequently, he joined the CMS
                    College, Kottayam, where he continued till 1972,
                    graduating with a Bachelors and Masters Degrees in
                    English literature. In 1973, Dn. Thomas joined the Old
                    Seminary, Kottayam for theological studies. He could
                    study there only for a year due to the erupting volatile
                    situation in the Malankara Church, which had its echoes
                    on the Seminary too. Finding it difficult to continue,
                    Dn. Thomas joined the Manjinikkara Dayra for Syriac
                    Studies and priestly formation. Under the spiritual
                    guidance of V. Rev. Jacob Madapattu Remban (later
                    Metropolitan H.G. Mar Julius Yakoub), he completed
                    liturgical studies. During the one year’s stay at the
                    monastery, he completed a Bachelor of Education degree
                    (B.Ed) at the NSS Training College, Pandalam. While at
                    the Seminary, late Metropolitan of Kottayam Diocese,
                    H.G. Mor Gregorius Gheevarghese (Perumpilly Thirumeni)
                    ordained him shamshono (full deacon).

                <p>
                    In 1975, H.G. Mor Philexinos Paulose (later Catholicos)
                    ordained him as a priest on. Thereupon, Fr. Thomas began
                    to assist the vicar of his parish. Later he began to
                    teach at the T.M. High School, Akkikavu, close to
                    Perumpilavu near Kunnamkulam. While teaching there, he
                    assisted Rev. Fr. K.V. Kuriakose (the late H.G. Mar
                    Julius Kuriakose), at the Simhasana Church, Kunnamkulam.
                    When late Mor Philexinos Paulose was consecrated as
                    Catholicose of the East, His Beatitude invited Fr.
                    Thomas to assist him at the Muvattupuzha Aramana. After
                    a few months, Fr. Thomas was appointed as vicar of the
                    St. Mary’s Church, Bangalore. This became a turning
                    point in his life. He served a congregation in that
                    capacity for eight years until 1984. During this period,
                    along with his pastoral duties, Fr. Thomas completed a
                    Bachelor of Divinity and Master of Theology Degrees. The
                    St. Mary’s Church in Bangalore was built during this
                    period.

                <p>
                    In 1984, Fr. Thomas became the vicar of St. Peter’s
                    Church, New Delhi. He served there for two years
                    organizing the parish. In 1986, he left for Germany for
                    higher studies and joined the Erlangen-Nuremberg
                    University. After completing studies in the German
                    language, he moved to the Goettingen University in 1987,
                    to pursue Syriac patristic studies. He returned to India
                    in 1990, after being elected to the bishopric of the
                    Outside Kerala Diocese. On 3rd January 1991, Fr. Thomas
                    was consecrated bishop by late H.B. Catholicos Baselius
                    Paulose II, giving the name Themotheos, and was
                    appointed to assist the Metropolitan of the Outside
                    Kerala Diocese, H.G. Mar Theophilus Thomas who was
                    advanced in age. When HG passed away on 12th January
                    1992, Mar Themotheos was given full responsibility for
                    the Diocese. The Metropolitan established his
                    administrative office at Mulund, Bombay. A new
                    publication, “The Vision” was started thereafter, and
                    continued to be published as a bilingual monthly, till
                    2009. In 1993, when a severe earthquake occurred in the
                    Latur district of Maharashtra, His Grace launched a
                    rehabilitation program with the support of the entire
                    Church. Gram Jyothi Social Welfare Centre was
                    established at the Harangul village in Latur which
                    served three villages with health clinics and
                    educational programs. Ten acres of land were purchased
                    in 1996 at Anagalpura near Bangalore city and a mission
                    center was organized there, and the Centre started the
                    St. George’s School, which is now a full-fledged high
                    School with 750 children studying.

                <p>
                    In 1998, when the late Metropolitan of Kottayam Diocese,
                    H.G. Gregorius Gheevarghese fell ill, Mar Themotheos
                    Thomas assumed responsibility of the Kottayam Diocese as
                    Assistant Metropolitan in 1998. After the demise of Mor
                    Gregorious (Perumpally Thirumeni) on February 22nd,
                    1999, full responsibility of the Diocese was entrusted
                    to Mor Themotheos. A couple of years later His Grace was
                    given responsibilities as Assistant Metropolitan of the
                    South Kerala Diocese of Thumpamon, Niranam, and Quilon
                    and continued this responsibility for the next three
                    years. His Grace served as the President of the
                    Malankara Syrian Orthodox Theological Seminary at
                    Udayagiri, near Mulanthuruthy for nine years from 1992
                    onwards. For three years His Grace was the President of
                    the Youth Association of the Malankara Church. His Grace
                    participated in the Vienna Consultations–the dialogue
                    between the Roman Catholic Church and the Oriental
                    Orthodox Churches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    H.G. represented the Syrian Orthodox Church in the
                    eighth Assembly of the World Council of Churches, held
                    at Harare in Zimbabwe in 1998, and the WCC Assembly of
                    2005, held in Brazil. H.G. is a regular participant in
                    forums of the National Council of Churches in India
                    (NCCI). From 2002 to 2006 he was the Vice-President of
                    the NCCI. Mar Themotheos has also been a key participant
                    in the dialogue between the Malankara Syrian Orthodox
                    Church and the Catholic Church which produced
                    breakthrough agreement on controversial issues, such as
                    inter-confessional marriages. As Metropolitan of the
                    Outside Kerala Diocese (later Syrian Orthodox
                    Arch-Diocese of Greater India), His Grace was able to
                    establish more than 50 parish churches throughout the
                    length and breadth of the Indian union. The Hosur
                    Mission Centre and the Bhiman Kuppa Centre at Hosur Road
                    in Mysore were developed under the leadership of
                    Metropolitan Thomas Themotheos. The Nest India
                    Foundation in Bombay for the destitute children (for
                    girls) was organized in 1998. It is functioning quite
                    well with its own building to accommodate 28 girl
                    children. A team of co-workers struggles hard for taking
                    care of the children and their education. It is a
                    commendable charity work initiated by His Grace. In the
                    Kottayam Diocese Snehitha, a charitable home for the
                    orphaned or semi-orphaned girl children was started in
                    April 24, 2007. It is functioning well with 16 girl
                    children. The Asraya Guidance and Counseling Centre is
                    actually an offshoot of the Anagalpura Mission Centre in
                    Bangalore. The Centre is providing lunch to a large
                    number of patients and their bystanders at the
                    Government Medical College Hospital, Kottayam. This was
                    begun on March 15, 2007.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout his spiritual life, he has given much
                    importance for education and providing education to the
                    younger generation who will be the steering wheel of the
                    next generation. In 1983 he started St. Mary’s School at
                    Queen’s Road, which has grown as a High School with one
                    thousand children now. Preparations for the beginning of
                    the Holy Cross College of Management and Technology
                    (HCCMAT) was begun in 2002.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Holy Cross Educational Trust was formed (incorporated)
                    in 2000. In 2001 Bombay Estate was purchased. In 2002
                    application was submitted for permission, to start a
                    Management College and it was granted in the same year.
                    In June 2003 the College was begun. The first building
                    of the College was completed in September 2003, and
                    classes were moved from the parish hall of St. Mary’s
                    Jacobite Church, Puttady, to the completed building.
